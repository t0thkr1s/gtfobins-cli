It is also required to have tty access to input characters such as keyboard access to the machine. It is\nusually best to save the following code snipet to a script (e.g. `priv-esc.sh`) and execute that as the first command\nwill take over the TTY and you will loose terminal access (if executed from the same TTY) until `hide-splash`.\n\n`show-splash` is used to take control over the TTY and display the splash screen. `pause-progress` is used to prevent\nplymouth from automatically quiting in some cases as we are already booted. `ask-for-password` will ask the user for a\ntext password (usually to decrypt a LUKS disk encryption). We can tell plymouth to send this input to any program, such\nas `/bin/sh` to execute whatever input we gave. Then run `hide-splash` to hide the splash screen and return to normal.\n",
